Overview
This Python script automates the migration of data between Odoo databases (source_db â†’ target_db). It efficiently transfers key tables such as res_users, res_partner, res_groups, res_company, and res_groups_users_rel, while ensuring data consistency and integrity.

One of the standout features of this script is its ability to migrate updated user passwords. When a password is changed in source_db, it gets transferred to target_db, allowing users to log in with their latest credentials post-migration.

Key Features
âœ… Migrates essential Odoo tables, including users, partners, groups, and companies.
âœ… Ensures updated passwords are migrated, maintaining user authentication.
âœ… Handles parent-child relationships, resolving references efficiently.
âœ… Resets sequences to maintain ID continuity in the target database.
âœ… Supports JSONB data type migration for fields like name and description.
âœ… Uses batch processing to optimize large data migrations.
